## Welcome to my GitHub. Below are some of my interests outside of work.

Machine Learning with the traditional stocks, algorithmic decision making, has been around for a while. And it has been utilized largely by institutions to provide them with a higher edge than the retail traders.
I like to write and attempt at creating an algorithm for trading cryptocurrencies to better my own trading interests.

Along with creating algo trading uses, I like to work on small security projects and dissect malwares for my own personal learning processes.

I am editing this on [editor on Github](https://github.com/joypark/joypark.github.io/edit/main/README.md) from my nova.panic app on apple.

I also have a personal [website](qixuan.me) that reflects my own resume and interests. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/joypark/joypark.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Below is some info for myself to keep. The site is not completed yet.	

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/joypark/joypark.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
