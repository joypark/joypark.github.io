## Welcome to my GitHub. Below are some of my interests outside of work.

Machine Learning with the traditional stocks, algorithmic decision making, has been around for a while. And it has been utilized largely by institutions to provide them with a higher edge than the retail traders.

I like to write and attempt at creating an algorithm for trading cryptocurrencies to better my own trading interests.

If interested, please take a look at my <img src="/images/tradingviewfavicon.png" width="48"> [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/u/ChaiQixuan/#published-scripts).

Along with creating algo trading uses, I like to work on small security projects and dissect malware for my own personal learning processes.

I am editing this on [editor on Github](https://github.com/joypark/joypark.github.io/edit/main/README.md) from my nova.panic app on apple.

I also have a personal [website](https://qixuan.me) that reflects my detailed resume.
